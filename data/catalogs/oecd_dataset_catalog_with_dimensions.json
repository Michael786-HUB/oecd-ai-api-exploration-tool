This dataset provides the extent of coastal floods for different return periods (10 to 100 years) with a 1-kilometre resolution. Built-up area exposure to coastal floods is computed by intersecting this map with Copernius annual land cover data (Copernicus Climate Change Service, Climate Data Store, 2019) and population exposure is computed using the Global Human Settlement Population layer (European Commission, GHSL Data Package 2023).\n\nDefinition of regions Regions are subnational units below national boundaries.

The carbon price signal stems from the Effective Carbon Rate (ECR) - the sum of fuel excise taxes, carbon taxes and tradeable permits that effectively put a price on carbon emissions. Progress with carbon pricing is discussed against three benchmarks. The more progress a country has made towards the relevant benchmark value, the higher the CPS. For example, a CPS of 100% against a EUR 60 per tonne CO2 benchmark (CPS60) means that a country or the group of countries prices all carbon emissions from energy use at EUR 60 or more. A CPS of 0% means that the country prices no emissions at all. An intermediate CPS between 0% and 100% means that some emissions are priced, but that not all emissions are priced at a level that equals or exceeds the benchmark.Companion dataset to Effective Carbon Rates (ECR). ECRs measure carbon pricing of CO2-emissions from energy use in more than 70 countries, including 45 OECD and G20 countries, covering over 80% of world emissions. The dataset provides a comprehensive view on carbon pricing, including fuel excise taxes, carbon taxes and tradable emission permit prices. For additional information, see the latest Effective Carbon Rates report. Annex A of the first publication of Effective Carbon Rates (OECD, 2016) provides a detailed description of the methodology for calculating ECRs.",

It builds on and expands the methodology and structure of the OECD Inventory of Support Measures for Fossil Fuels and expands its coverage to the Western Balkans. The Inventory covers the six economies of the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia). This inventory follows the methodological approach of the OECD FFS inventory but expands upon it by broadening the scope to include induced and financial support for both fossil fuels and renewable sources of energy.\nThis Inventory was developed as part of the OECD project on Energy Prices and Subsidies in the Western Balkans: Reforms for a Fair and Green Future. The Inventory formed the report's primary analytical basis, and the report presents further details on the construction of the inventory data.\u00a0\nThe Inventory identifies individual support schemes and provides detailed information and corresponding values for each, similarly to the OECD FFS inventory.\u00a0The number of schemes identified ranges between 18 in Montenegro and 40 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These schemes support both fossil fuel and renewable energy production and consumption. The Inventory covers subsidies and support measures identified over the period 2018-2023.\n*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244/99 and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on Kosovo\u2019s declaration of independence.",

        "description": "Country Programmable Aid (CPA) refers to official development assistance (ODA) that is subject to multi-year planning at the country or regional level. The OECD has published data on CPA at the aggregate level (provider-partner country) since 2007.\n\nThis data represents an update to the measurement of CPA. The main improvement is that this version is derived entirely from the OECD's aid activity database, the Creditor Reporting System (CRS). CPA is calculated by subtracting the following categories of aid from the total of gross bilateral ODA (category = 10):\n\u2022 Debt relief (modality: F01 and sector: 600)\n\u2022 Humanitarian aid (sector codes: 720,730,740)\n\u2022 Administrative costs not included elsewhere (modality: G01 and sector: 910)\n\u2022 Scholarships/training in donor country (modality: E01)\n\u2022 Imputed student costs (modality: E02)\n\u2022 Promotion of development awareness (modality: H01)\n\u2022 Refugees in donor country (modality: H02-H06 and sector: 930)\n\u2022 Core support to NGOs (modality: B01)\n\u2022 Equity investments (measure: 5xx)\n\u2022 Other unallocated (sector code: 998 OR recipient: \"Developing countries unspecified\")\n\u2022 CPA = 1 (see \"Agency\" sheet in the 'DAC and CRS code lists', under Resources and guidance material for reporters)This measurement is an improvement from the previous CPA measure, which was derived from a combination of the OECD's aggregate aid tables and the CRS, resulting in an aggregate (provider-partner country) perspective on CPA. The result of the new measure is an activity-level perspective on CPA that provides much greater transparency on its composition and thereby allows users to conduct more granular analysis (e.g., by sector, channel, modality, etc.) on who is giving CPA where, how, and for what purpose. The measure is also therefore more replicable to users.\n\nThe time series of the CPA measure starts with 2022 in the \u201cTable\u201d view to differentiate it from the previous CPA measure, which was calculated at an aggregate level up to 2021. These two measures should not be presented together in a time series. For users who are interested in the time series using the new CPA measure, a version of the dataset that applies the new CPA measure retroactively from 2010 onwards has been produced and can be found under, \u201cRelated files\u201d.\n\nFor more information on this measure, please see: Country programmable aid in official development assistance (ODA).\n\nPlease note: Germany has reported only semi-aggregated data for part of the BMZ data for this release (approx. EUR 4 billion), due to an internal transition of their IT systems that resulted in granular data on recipients, sectors, and policy markers (for example) not yet being available for submission to the OECD.

The agreed treatment of PSI aims to enhance the measurement of donor effort, stimulate innovation in development finance, and encourage the mobilisation of private finance. It also seeks to promote local private sector development and domestic resource mobilisation, while strengthening ODA integrity.\n\nThis dataset provides readily available, granular data on who is extending PSI, to where, using which financial instruments and for what purpose. The data is presented both on a flow and grant equivalent bases (the latter being the measurement basis for ODA since 2018) and includes information of the additionality of the transactions with the private sector. The data are comparable across all providers who report their activity-level statistics to the OECD.\n\nPlease consult our database of development finance classifications for further information on all possible codes for each attribute.\n\nFor more information on PSI, please see the OECD's pages on ODA standards and ODA modernisation, including frequently asked questions (FAQs) on ODA modernisation and PSI. See also the addendum 3 of the converged statistical reporting directives governing PSI data, the Handbook on private sector instruments, alongside other guidance on using our data. You can also consult the dashboard on private sector instruments providing further data visualisations on PSI (forthcoming).",

A scoring system of three values is used, in which aid activities are marked as targeting environment as the \"principal\" or \"significant\" objective, or not at all. For more information on the scoring and criteria, please see here. Please note that the same activity can be marked for several objectives, and therefore caution should be used to avoid double-counting.\n\nFor more information on these flows, please see the OECD's main page on official development assistance and finance for sustainable development, including frequently asked questions (FAQs) on ODA.

Established in 2007, the Network unites experts from OECD member countries to examine how domestic policies affect developing nations. Initially composed of representatives from Foreign Affairs ministries and development agencies, including DAC Delegates, it expanded after the 2015 adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs to include officials responsible for national SDG coordination\u2014often from Centres of Government or ministries tasked with whole-of-government coordination.\n\n Responses were collected between November 2023 and January 2024. The 2023 database comprises responses from 24 OECD countries and 1 accession country..",

The correspondence table between SAUs and FUAs/cities is available at this link.\n\nWhen population by age and sex data is not available at such granular level, FUA and city level indicators are estimated by adjusting the regional (OECD TL3 regions) values to the FUA and city boundaries, based on the population distribution in each region. Regional values (population by age and sex) in TL3 regions are used as data inputs and combined with gridded total population data (European Commission, GHSL Data Package 2023). FUA and city boundaries are intersected with TL3 borders and coefficients are computed for each region, based on the share of the regional population that lives within the FUA/city. These coefficients are then applied to the variables of interest (e.g. population by age groups) and allocated to the FUA/city. In case several regions intersect the FUA/city, the adjusted values of intersecting regions are summed. This approach assumes that the variables of interest have the same spatial distribution as the total population. Therefore, the modelled indicators should be interpreted with caution.\n\n**Defining FUAs and cities\n\nThe OECD, in cooperation with the EU, has developed a harmonised definition of functional urban areas (FUAs) to capture the economic and functional reach of cities based on daily commuting patterns (OECD, 2012). FUAs consist of:\n\n\u2022 A city \u2013 defined by urban centres in the degree of urbanisation, adapted to the closest local administrative units to define a city.\n\u2022 A commuting zone \u2013 including all local areas where at least 15% of employed residents work in the city.\n\nThe delineation process includes:\n\n\u2022 Assigning municipalities surrounded by a single FUA to that FUA.\n\u2022 Excluding non-contiguous municipalities.\n\nThe definition identifies 1 285 FUAs and 1 402 cities in all OECD member countries except Costa Rica and three accession countries.\n\n**Cite this dataset\n\nOECD Regions, cities and local areas database (Population by age and sex - Cities and FUAs),\u00a0http://oe.cd/geostats\n\n**Further information\n\n\u2022 OECD Local Data Portal \n\u2022 OECD Regions and Cities at a Glance \n\nFor questions and/or comments, please email CitiesStat@oecd.org",

The estimates for areas with missing official data are based on the electricity generation mix at the national level (based on the issued from the International Energy Agency (IEA) database, the location of electricity generation assets using the Global Power Plant Database (GPPD, Global Energy Observatory et al., 2018) and the harmonised global dataset on wind and solar installations (Dunnett et al., 2020). Electricity generation is estimated by matching energy sources across datasets, calculating each power plant's share of national capacity, and distributing the official regional and national generation accordingly across the different subnational areas.\n\nThe carbon intensity of electricity generation is defined as the amount of CO2 equivalent emissions produced per unit of electricity generated (gCO2eq/kWh). It is obtained by applying emission factors to the different energy sources.\n\nDefinition of regions\nRegions are subnational units below national boundaries.

The correspondence table between SAUs and FUAs/cities is available at this link.\n\nWhen population by age and sex data is not available at such granular level, FUA and city level indicators are estimated by adjusting the regional (OECD TL3 regions) values to the FUA and city boundaries, based on the population distribution in each region. Regional values (population by age and sex) in TL3 regions are used as data inputs and combined with gridded total population data (European Commission, GHSL Data Package 2023). FUA and city boundaries are intersected with TL3 borders and coefficients are computed for each region, based on the share of the regional population that lives within the FUA/city. These coefficients are then applied to the variables of interest (e.g. population by age groups) and allocated to the FUA/city. In case several regions intersect the FUA/city, the adjusted values of intersecting regions are summed. This approach assumes that the variables of interest have the same spatial distribution as the total population. Therefore, the modelled indicators should be interpreted with caution.\n\n**Defining FUAs and cities\n\nThe OECD, in cooperation with the EU, has developed a harmonised definition of functional urban areas (FUAs) to capture the economic and functional reach of cities based on daily commuting patterns (OECD, 2012). FUAs consist of:\n\n\u2022 A city \u2013 defined by urban centres in the degree of urbanisation, adapted to the closest local administrative units to define a city.\n\u2022 A commuting zone \u2013 including all local areas where at least 15% of employed residents work in the city.\n\nThe delineation process includes:\n\n\u2022 Assigning municipalities surrounded by a single FUA to that FUA.\n\u2022 Excluding non-contiguous municipalities.\n\nThe definition identifies 1 285 FUAs and 1 402 cities in all OECD member countries except Costa Rica and three accession countries.\n\n**Cite this dataset\n\nOECD Regions, cities and local areas database (Dependency ratio - Cities and FUAs),\u00a0http://oe.cd/geostats\n\n**Further information\n\nFor any question or comment, please write to RegionStat@oecd.org\n\n**Further information\n\n\u2022 OECD Local Data Portal \n\u2022 OECD Regions and Cities at a Glance \n\nFor questions and/or comments, please email CitiesStat@oecd.org",

It is calculated by totalling the age-specific fertility rates as defined over five-year intervals for women aged 15 to 49.\n\u2022 Live births are registered at the usual place fo residence of the mother. Crude live birth rate is expressed for 1000 population.\n\u2022 Child-to-woman ratio\u00a0is the number of children aged 0 to 4 in over women aged 15 to 49.\n\nData is collected from Eurostat (reg_dem) for EU countries and via delegates of the OECD Working Party on Territorial Indicators (WPTI), as well as from national statistical offices' websites.\n\nDefinition of regions\n\nRegions are subnational units below national boundaries. OECD countries have two regional levels: large regions (territorial level 2 or TL2) and small regions (territorial level 3 or TL3). The OECD regions are presented in the OECD Territorial grid (pdf) and in the OECD Territorial correspondence table (xlsx).\u00a0\n\nUse of data on small regions\n\nWhen demographic data are analysed along with economic data using the TL3 level, it is advisable to aggregate data at the metropolitan region level when several TL3 regions are associated to the same metropolitan region. Metropolitan regions combine TL3 regions when 50% or more of the regional population live in a functionnal urban areas above 250 000 inhabitants. This approach corrects the distortions created by commuting, see the list of OECD metropolitan regions (xlsx) and the EU methodology (link).\n\nTerritorial typologies\nSmall TL3 regions are categorized based on shared characteristics into regional typologies.

It also shows the flows that take place each year, such as contributions received by pension schemes and benefits paid to retirees. It is a supplementary national accounts table based on Table 17.10 of the 2008 System of National Accounts and Table 17.15 of the European System of Accounts 2010. \n\nThe definition of social insurance pensions is social security or employment-related pensions that provide beneficiaries with an entitlement to income in retirement resulting from contributions made during their working lives. To quality as a social insurance pension scheme, participation in the scheme must be mandatory and/or the scheme must be collective and/or an employer must make a contribution.\n\nLiabilities of social insurance pension schemes are calculated in the national accounts on an accrued-to-date basis, which takes into account benefits due based on contributions made to date. The results are not suitable for fiscal sustainability analysis because they do not take into account future accruals of entitlements.\n\nThe presentation of this table is on a country-by-country basis. Users are recommended to select one country (or area) at a time in the \u2018Reference area\u2019 filter. It is also possible to select a single \u2018Transaction\u2019 such as closing balance (of liabilities) for comparisons between countries.\n\n Further information can be obtained from the Guidelines for the OECD Table on social insurance pension schemes.\n\nThese indicators were presented in the previous dissemination system in the SNA_TABLE29 dataset.\n\nExplore also the GDP and non-financial accounts webpage: GDP and non-financial accounts webpage\nOECD statistics contact: STAT.Contact@oecd.org",

Indicators are selected based on a multi-dimensional and forward looking approach to child well-being, centred on the idea that children should be able to both enjoy a \u201cgood\u201d positive childhood in the here and now, and have the opportunity to develop skills and abilities that set them up well for the future. While the data look to cover the well-being of children of all ages, limitations in data availability mean that most indicators focus on those in middle childhood and adolescence. This dataset represents a selection of headline indicators from the OECD Child Well-being Data Portal, a tool for policy makers and the public to monitor countries\u2019 efforts to promote child well being.

The indicator is derived from internet speed tests taken from mobile devices with GPS-quality location and a non-cellular connection type (e.g. WiFi, ethernet). Yearly values are based on the weighted average of quarterly values, using the number of speed tests performed.\n\n**Defining FUAs and cities\n\nThe OECD, in cooperation with the EU, has developed a harmonised definition of functional urban areas (FUAs) to capture the economic and functional reach of cities based on daily commuting patterns (OECD, 2012). FUAs consist of:\n\n\u2022 A city \u2013 defined by urban centres in the degree of urbanisation, adapted to the closest local administrative units to define a city.\n\u2022 A commuting zone \u2013 including all local areas where at least 15% of employed residents work in the city.\n\nThe delineation process includes:\n\n\u2022 Assigning municipalities surrounded by a single FUA to that FUA.\n\u2022 Excluding non-contiguous municipalities.\n\nThe definition identifies 1 285 FUAs and 1 402 cities in all OECD member countries except Costa Rica and three accession countries.\n\n**Cite this dataset\n\nOECD Regions, cities and local areas database (Internet speed - Cities and FUAs),\u00a0http://oe.cd/geostats\n\n**Further information\n\n\u2022 OECD Local Data Portal \n\u2022 OECD Regions and Cities at a Glance \n\nFor questions and/or comments, please email CitiesStat@oecd.org",

Coverage includes OECD member and accession countries, key partners (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and South Africa), and other selected non-OECD economies. This is an experimental indicator, developed under the OECD\u2019s Fundstat initiative to improve evidence on the directionality and societal relevance of research and development (R&D) activities, by linking scientific output to 17 SDGs or none. To produce this indicator, the OECD developed a probabilistic AI-assisted classification model that identifies the SDG relevance of scientific publications based on their titles and abstracts. The approach builds on insights from the OECD International Survey of Science (ISSA2021), in which researchers reported which SDG their research contributed to. Using these responses, a labelled dataset was created to fine-tune SciBERT, a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on scientific literature, enabling it to predict the probability of relevance of a given text to each of the 17 SDGs, or to none. The trained classifier is then applied to publication titles and abstracts from the Scopus Custom Data. Publication counts are fractionalised across countries and aggregated annually for comparability. For further information on the methodology, see: Aristodemou, L., et al.

Implied R&D tax subsidy rates are defined as 1 minus the B-Index, a measure of the before-tax income needed by a \u201crepresentative\u201d firm to break even on one additional monetary unit of R&D outlay (Warda, 2001; OECD, 2023). The more generous the tax provisions for R&D, the lower the before-tax breakeven economic return required by firms and the higher the implied marginal R&D tax subsidy. The OECD time-series estimates of implied R&D tax subsidy rates is based on headline tax credit and allowance rates. Due to limited historical data availability, the estimates are not adjusted for provisions that bound the tax benefits received by firms (e.g. ceilings, thresholds). They therefore provide an upper bound for the marginal tax subsidy implied by R&D tax relief measures at central government level across countries over time. OECD (2019) provides a practical guide to using the OECD R&D Tax Incentives database, describing the R&D tax incentive time series data and highlighting their potential for internationally comparative work through descriptive indicators and econometric analysis.",

Regional values (GDP and jobs) in TL3 regions are used as data inputs and combined with gridded population data (European Commission, GHSL Data Package 2023). FUA boundaries are intersected with TL3 borders to compute the share of the regional population that lives within FUAs in each region. This share is then applied to the variable of interest (e.g. GDP) and allocated to the FUA. In case several regions intersect the FUA, the adjusted values of intersecting regions are summed. For countries where TL3-level data is not available, data for TL2 regions is used. This approach assumes that the variable of interest has the same spatial distribution as population. Therefore, the modelled indicators should be interpreted with caution.\n\nWhen a more granular level is available, data is aggregated for each FUA. For example in the United States, GDP estimates are available at the county-level (US Bureau of Economic Analysis), and then aggregated by FUA.\n\n**Defining FUAs and cities\n\nThe OECD, in cooperation with the EU, has developed a harmonised definition of functional urban areas (FUAs) to capture the economic and functional reach of cities based on daily commuting patterns (OECD, 2012). FUAs consist of:\n\n\u2022 A city \u2013 defined by urban centres in the degree of urbanisation, adapted to the closest local administrative units to define a city.\n\u2022 A commuting zone \u2013 including all local areas where at least 15% of employed residents work in the city.\n\nThe delineation process includes:\n\n\u2022 Assigning municipalities surrounded by a single FUA to that FUA.\n\u2022 Excluding non-contiguous municipalities.\n\nThe definition identifies 1 285 FUAs and 1 402 cities in all OECD member countries except Costa Rica and three accession countries.\n\n**Cite this dataset\n\nOECD Regions, cities and local areas database (Economy - FUAs),\u00a0http://oe.cd/geostats\n\n**Further information\n\n\u2022 OECD Local Data Portal \n\u2022 OECD Regions and Cities at a Glance \n\nFor questions and/or comments, please email CitiesStat@oecd.org",

This classification facilitates greater comparability of geographic units at the same territorial level.\n\nThe list and maps of OECD regions are presented in the OECD Territorial grid (pdf).\n\nUse of economic data on small regions\n\nWhen economic analyses are carried out at the TL3 level, it is advisable to aggregate data at the metropolitan region level when several TL3 regions are associated to the same metropolitan region. Metropolitan regions combine TL3 regions when 50% or more of the regional population live in a functionnal urban areas above 250 000 inhabitants. This approach corrects the distortions created by commuting.

Many indicators are expressed as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or as a percentage of Gross Disposable Income (GDI) when referring to the Households and NPISHs sector. The definition of GDP and GDI are the following:\n\nGross Domestic Product:\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is derived from the concept of value added. Gross value added is the difference of output and intermediate consumption. GDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.138].\nGDP is also equal to the sum of final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers\u2019 prices, less the value of imports of goods and services [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.139].\nGDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by producer units [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.140].\n\nGross Disposable Income:\n\nGross Disposable Income (GDI) is equal to net disposable income which is the balancing item of the secondary distribution income account plus the consumption of fixed capital. The use of the Gross Disposable Income (GDI), rather than net disposable income, is preferable for analytical purposes because there are uncertainty and comparability problems with the calculation of consumption of fixed capital.\nGDI measures the income available to the total economy for final consumption and gross saving [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 2.145].\n\nDefinition of Debt:\n\nDebt is a commonly used concept, defined as a specific subset of liabilities identified according to the types of financial instruments included or excluded. Generally, debt is defined as all liabilities that require payment or payments of interest or principal by the debtor to the creditor at a date or dates in the future.\nConsequently, all debt instruments are liabilities, but some liabilities such as shares, equity and financial derivatives are not debt [System of National Accounts, 2008, par. 22.104].\nAccording to the SNA, most debt instruments are valued at market prices. However, some countries do not apply this valuation, in particular for securities other than shares, except financial derivatives (AF33).\nIn this dataset, for financial indicators referring to debt, the concept of debt is the one adopted by the SNA 2008 as well as by the International Monetary Fund in \u201cPublic Sector Debt Statistics \u2013 Guide for compilers and users\u201d (Pre-publication draft, May 2011).\nDebt is thus obtained as the sum of the following liability categories, whenever available / applicable in the financial balance sheet of the institutional sector:special drawing rights (AF12), currency and deposits (AF2), debt securities (AF3), loans (AF4), insurance, pension, and standardised guarantees (AF6), and other accounts payable (AF8).\nThis definition differs from the definition of debt applied under the Maastricht Treaty for European countries. First, gross debt according to the Maastricht definition excludes not only financial derivatives and employee stock options (AF7) and equity and investment fund shares (AF5) but also insurance pensions and standardised guarantees (AF6) and other accounts payable (AF8). Second, debt according to Maastricht definition is valued at nominal prices and not at market prices.\n\nTo view other related indicator datasets, please refer to:\n\nInstitutional Investors Indicators [add link]\n\nHousehold Dashboard [add link]",

Data is presented for each country in national currency as well as in euros for the European Union and the euro area.

Users are recommended to select one country (or area) at a time in the \u2018Reference area\u2019 filter. The default view shows all transactions (GDP and components) for the selected area, but it is possible to select specific components and sub-components of GDP using the \u2018Transaction\u2019 filter. The sector to which the selected transactions relate will be shown in the 'Institutional sector' filter, and further options (if applicable) will be shown under the \u2018Financial instruments and non-financial assets\u2019 filter. It is also possible to select current prices, chain linked volumes etc using the \u2018Price base\u2019 filter (the default view is current prices). \n\n The table shows OECD countries and selected economies, as well as the OECD total, OECD Europe, European Union and euro area.

They are well known for providing advance warning of turning points in aggregate economic activity as measured by GDP or industrial production. As respondents provide answers on a 3 scale options (up, same, down, or above normal, normal, below normal), data are summarised in net balances corresponsing to the difference in % of positive over negative replies. Because of their collection mode, timeliness and immediate availability, they have proved to be a cost\u2011effective mean of generating timely information especially during crises. \nIn the late '90, in collaboration with the European Commission, the OECD has developed a system of harmonised business tendency surveys in order to collect and compare data across countries.\nThe EC Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs is since then in charge of running the program and collecting data across EU members, while the OECD helped the adoption and implementation \nof the same harmonised framework in non-EU OECD countries and BRIICS. By construction, BTS questions are formulated in order to exclude seasonal factors. Nevertheless all series are tested for seasonality by both the OECD (using x12) and by the EC for the EU member data (using DAINTIES).

Therefore, the main message of CLI movements over time is the increase or decrease, rather than the amplitude of the changes. The OECD\u2019s headline indicator is the amplitude adjusted CLI. In practice, turning points in the de-trended reference series have been found about 4 to 8 months (on average) after the signals of turning points had been detected in the headline CLI. Detailed information on the OECD methodology for CLIs can be found on the OECD website at: OECD CLIsCLIs are calculated for G20 countries plus Spain and 5 zone aggregates.

Typically they are based on a sample of households and respondents are asked about their assessments of the current situation and expectations for the immediate future. In the case of consumer surveys their intentions concerning major purposes, economic situation now compared with the recent past and expectations for the immediate future. Many survey series provide advance warning of turning points in aggregate economic activity as measured by GDP or industrial production. Such series are known as leading indicators in cyclical analysis. These types of survey series are widely used as component series in composite leading indicators. The main characteristic of these types of surveys is that instead of asking for exact figures, they usually ask for the direction of change e.g. a question on tendency by reference to a \u201cnormal\u201d state, e.g. of production level. Possible answers are generally of the five point scale type e.g. increase sharply/increase slightly/remain the same/fall slightly/fall sharply for consumer surveys. In presenting the results as a time series, only the balance is shown. That is \u201csame\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d answers are ignored and the balance is obtained by taking the difference between percentages of respondents giving favourable and unfavourable answers.Virtually all consumer opinion survey data are presented as time series of balances in this dataset, either in raw or seasonally adjusted form. Very few series are presented as indices, and where these exist they have generally been converted from underlying balances by countries before submitting the data to the OECD.OECD statistics contactStatistics and Data Directorate",

Normalisation is achieved by subtracting from the CCI its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. A value of 100 is added for rescaling purposes. In this form, an OECD Consumer Barometer reading greater than 100 signals a boost in consumer confidence towards the future, indicating an attitude to spend more on major purchases in the coming year, complemented by a modest propensity to save. Conversely, values below 100 indicate a pessimistic approach towards future developments in the economy, valuing saving over consumption. OECD statistics contactStatistics and Data Directorate",

        "description": "Monetary aggregates measure the amount of money circulating in an economy. National series are loaded as national currency stock series. Mostly, these are end-of-month. A few countries compile data more frequently e.g. weekly which enables them to calculate \u201caverage for the month\u201d data. Series are also presented in index form, calculated by OECD. Monetary aggregates are always expressed in current price (\u201cnominal\u201d terms) because the amount of money required by an economy reflects current levels of economic activity and price. Here they are presented both as stock series in national currency and as indices in the OECD standard base year. There are many monetary aggregates. Statistically, they are items in the balance sheet of the banking system. They may be taken from either side (since credit series, which are banking assets, are sometimes labeled monetary aggregates) but are normally taken from the liabilities side. In the balance sheet the liabilities items are ordered, starting with very narrow definitions of money (such as notes and coin) and gradually widening through various types of bank accounts (e.g. sight deposits, term deposits) to very board items which include sophisticated products like financial derivatives. In other words, narrow money measures cover highly liquid forms of money (money as a means of exchange) while broad money includes the less liquid forms (money as a store of value). There were no internationally recognised standards for compiling monetary aggregates until the IMF published its Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual in 2000 (Monetary and Financial Statistics Manua). Cross-country comparability suffered as a result. Now, notably, the European Central Bank\u2019s framework for constructing Euro area monetary aggregates is consistent with IMF principles and non-euro EU countries are also required to report data to ECB according to the framework as are EU candidate countries as part of their application process. A useful IMF link for national methodologies is IMF methodologies. Here is used a general definition of narrow money \u2013 M1 is: currency i.e. banknotes and coins, plus overnight deposits. M2 is: the sum of M1, deposits with an agreed maturity of up to two years and deposits redeemable at notice of up to three months. And broad money \u2013 M3 is: the sum of M2, repurchase agreements, money market fund shares/units and debt securities up to two years.The narrow and broad money indices are calculated by OECD from the national stock series. Country indices are calculated by first estimating period averages where the country only supplies end-of-period stock data. The figure for the end of the previous period is taken as the opening stock for the current period. The arithmetic average of the two is the estimate for the period average. These, or true monthly averages where available, are divided by the annual average of the monthly data in the base period to obtain the index.OECD statistics contactStatistics and Data Directorate",

        "description": "The balance of payments is a statistical statement that provides a systematic summary of economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world, for a specific time period. The transactions are for the most part between residents and non-residents of the economy. A transaction is defined as an economic flow that reflects the creation, transformation, exchange, transfer, or extinction of economic value and involves changes in ownership, of goods or assets, the provision of services, labour or capital.\n\nThis dataset presents economies compiling balance of payments statistics in accordance with the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual published by the IMF (BPM6). Transactions include: the goods and services accounts, the primary income account (income account in BPM5), the secondary income account (transfers in BPM5), the capital account, and the financial account.\n\nAll economies disseminated here produce balance of payments according to BPM6; providing strong cross-country comparability.\nAs such the main purpose of this dataset is to provide relevant, reliable, consistent, comparable and timely aggregate quarterly balance of payments statistics for analytical purposes. Nevertheless there are some deviations from standard definitions that are indicated in notes (see \u00ab i \u00bb attached to series).\n\nIn the financial account, for net value, a positive sign indicates a net flow from the domestic economy to the rest of the world (a lending to the rest of the world) and a negative sign, a net flow from the rest of the world to the domestic economy (i.e. a net borrowing from the rest of the world). At the level of the sub items (investment abroad investment in the reporting economy etc.), a positive sign indicates an increase of the sub item under consideration and a negative sign a decrease. These conventions are imposed by the BPM6.\n\nThe dataflow covers : all OECD member countries, G20 economies and a selection of non-member economies.\n\nThe currency unit used for all series is:\nMillions of US dollars or Millions of National Currency.\n\nOECD statistics contact: stat.contact@oecd.org\n\nhttp://www.oecd.org/sdd",

The update cycle is on a rolling basis: each variable in the dataset is made publicly available as soon as it is updated in the sources databases. The productivity database contains data on labour productivity both measured using employment or hours worked and the compenents of capital and labour inputs. The productivity database in levels, in growth rates and by industry contains annual data, while the database on productivity and unit labour costs are quarterly estimates. Further information for all datasets and the methodology may be found in the attached file OECD-Productivity-Statistics-Database-metadata",

        "description": "This dataset contains monthly Comparative Price Levels (CPL) for OECD countries. CPLs are defined as the ratios of PPPs for private final consumption expenditure to exchange rates. They provide measures of differences in price levels between countries. The monthly PPPs used to derive the table are OECD estimates. The table is to be read vertically. Each column shows the number of specified monetary units needed in each of the countries listed to buy the same representative basket of consumer goods and services. In each case the representative basket costs a hundred units in the country whose currency is specified. Let\u2019s take an example. If you are a Canadian citizen and you want to know the price level in Canada when compared to other countries, you have to look at the column Canada, where the price level is set at 100 for the whole column. If you have 120 for Finland, it means that the price level in Finland is 20% higher than in Canada. It means that you would spend 120 dollars in Finland to buy the same basket of goods and services when you spend 100 in Canada. \n\n The monthly PPPs used to derive the table are obtained by extrapolating 2022 PPPs for household final consumption expenditure using the relative rates of inflation between the countries as measured by their consumer price indices. Unless a country is a high inflation country, its PPP will tend to change slowly over time. Month-to-month changes in comparative price levels are more likely to be the result of exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n Updated data are available at the beginning of each month. \n Click here for release dates\n\n OECD statistics contact: stat.contact@oecd.org",

Regional values (labour force, employment and unemployment) in TL3 regions are used as data inputs and combined with gridded population data (European Commission, GHSL Data Package 2023). FUA boundaries are intersected with TL3 borders to compute the share of the regional population that lives within FUAs in each region. This share is then applied to the variable of interest (e.g. employment) and allocated to the FUA. In case several regions intersect the FUA, the adjusted values of intersecting regions are summed. For countries where TL3-level data is not available, data for TL2 regions is used. This approach assumes that the variable of interest has the same spatial distribution as population. Therefore, the modelled indicators should be interpreted with caution.\n\nWhen a more granular level is available, data is aggregated for each FUA. For example in the United States, labour market data is available at the county-level (US Bureau of Labor Statistics), and then aggregated by FUA.\n\n**Defining FUAs and cities\n\nThe OECD, in cooperation with the EU, has developed a harmonised definition of functional urban areas (FUAs) to capture the economic and functional reach of cities based on daily commuting patterns (OECD, 2012). FUAs consist of:\n\n\u2022 A city \u2013 defined by urban centres in the degree of urbanisation, adapted to the closest local administrative units to define a city.\n\u2022 A commuting zone \u2013 including all local areas where at least 15% of employed residents work in the city.\n\nThe delineation process includes:\n\n\u2022 Assigning municipalities surrounded by a single FUA to that FUA.\n\u2022 Excluding non-contiguous municipalities.\n\nThe definition identifies 1 285 FUAs and 1 402 cities in all OECD member countries except Costa Rica and three accession countries.\n\n**Cite this dataset\n\nOECD Regions, cities and local areas database (Labour market - FUAs),\u00a0http://oe.cd/geostats\n\n**Further information\n\n\u2022 OECD Local Data Portal \n\u2022 OECD Regions and Cities at a Glance \n\nFor questions and/or comments, please email CitiesStat@oecd.org",

Metropolitan regions are further classified into: metropolitan large, if more than half of the population live in a (large) FUA of at least 1.5 million inhabitants; and metropolitan midsize, if more than half of the population live in a (midsize) FUA of at 250 000 to 1.5 million inhabitants.\n\u2022 Non-metropolitan regions, if less than half of the population live in a midsize/large FUA. These regions are further classified according to their level of access to FUAs of different sizes: near a midsize/large FUA if more than half of the population live within a 60-minute drive from a midsize/large FUA (of more than 250 000 inhabitants) or if the TL3 region contains more than 80% of the area of a midsize/large FUA; near a small FUA if the region does not have access to a midsize/large FUA and at least half of its population have access to a small FUA (i.e. between 50 000 and 250 000 inhabitants) within a 60-minute drive, or contains 80% of the area of a small FUA; and remote, otherwise.\n\nList of OECD regions and typologies are presented in the OECD Territorial correspondence table\u00a0(xlsx).

Pre-2003 data have been revised. \n Please note: Net Replacement Rates (NRR) provide a more complete measure of benefit generosity and income maintenance, especially when compared over longer periods of unemployment. \n Updating and maintainenance of the gross replacement rate (GRR) index, originally constructed as part of the OECD Jobs Study (1994), was reliant on access to Average Production Worker (APW) wages. These data have not been collected by the OECD since 2005 and the Historical GRR series has been dismissed. Instead, the OECD provides annually since 2001 the NRR indicator based on a slightly different definition of the reference wage, the Average Wage (AW), for most OECD and EU countries.\nCalculations for families with children assume 2 children aged 4 and 6 who do not use formal childcare.",

Data are broken down by professional status - employees, total employment - sex and standardised age groups (15-24, 25-54, 55+, total).\n\nNational definitions of part-time work vary considerably across OECD countries. Essentially three main approaches can be distinguished: i) a classification based on the worker\u2019s perception of his/her employment situation; ii) a cut-off (generally 30 or 35 hours per week) based on usual working hours, with persons usually working fewer hours being considered part-timers; iii) a comparable cut-off based on actual hours worked during the reference week. A criterion based on actual hours will generally yield a part-time rate higher than one based on usual hours, particularly if there are temporary reductions in working time as a result of holidays, illness, short-timing, etc. On the other hand, it is not entirely clear whether a classification based on the worker\u2019s perception will necessarily yield estimates of part-time work that are higher or lower than one based on a fixed cut-off. In one country (France) which changed from 1981 to 1982 from a definition based on an actual hours cut-off (30 hours) to one based on the respondent\u2019s perception, the latter criterion appeared to produce slightly higher estimates.\n\nOther factors as well affect the international comparability of the estimates. In some countries, the hours\u2019 cut-off is based on hours for the main job, in others on total hours for all jobs.

The OECD ITIC dataset combines the largest and most detailed cross-country sample of official national statistics on observed CIF-FOB margins with model estimates, providing information on CIF/FOB margins for more than 200 reporters and 240 partners and over 1200 products (HS 2017 at 4 digits), covering the period 1995 to 2022.\n\nThe OECD ITIC dataset is built in four steps. First, a gravity model is estimated based on the reported CIF/FOB margins at HS 6-digit product level (available for 34 countries). Second, the gravity-model coefficients are used to derive estimates for countries which do not explicitly report CIF/FOB margins. Third, the observations that could not be estimated by the model are derived from the estimated margins using standard statistical techniques. Finally, estimates are calibrated to explicitly reported data for countries that provide incomplete time series of observed margins. The final ITIC dataset consists of a combination of reported data and different types of estimates and includes specific codes which identify the methodology behind each observation.\n\nITIC constitutes an important tool to further the understanding of global value chains and forms a crucial input to the development of coherent and balanced bilateral trade statistics.\n\nNote:\n\n\u2022 In ITIC, the reference area corresponds to the importer, while the counterpart area is the exporter.\n\u2022 The margin is calculated as (CIF-FOB)/CIF and is the percentage of the CIF value of imports that correspond to the international transport and insurance costs.\n\u2022 CIF = Cost, Insurance and Freight\n\u2022 FOB = Free on Board\n\n For more information on the methodology, please refer to the working paper accompanying this dataset Recent trends in transport and insurance costs and estimates at disaggregated product level\n\nUsers are encouraged to send their questions, or to signal any apparent errors, regarding this database to STAT.Contact@oecd.org\nhttp://www.oecd.org/sdd",

The accounting framework is organised around a tri-axial system for the recording of healthcare expenditure, namely classifications of the functions of healthcare (ICHA-HC), healthcare provision (ICHA-HP), and financing schemes (ICHA-HF).",

This information is typically tracked at national aggregate levels to meet the need to ensure an efficient, appropriate allocation of resources in the production of healthcare services. Specific policy needs may require information regarding total payments for human resources, expenditure on pharmaceuticals, and other significant inputs. Furthermore, the financial planning of health programmes and services often relies on information about the volume and mixture of factor spending.",

This dataset provides information about the contribution mechanisms the particular financing schemes use to raise their revenues. Understanding the nature of the flows is of importance from the perspective of both health and public finance policy. For example, the classification of revenues makes it possible to distinguish between public and private funding of healthcare finance. Understanding how resources are raised by financing schemes is important for many countries, as many health systems are struggling with the issue of funding. The classification of revenues of financing schemes is suitable for tracking the collection mechanisms of a financing framework. Furthermore, the new classification makes it possible to analyse the contribution of the institutional units to health financing.",

While human resources are essential to the health and long-term care sector, physical resources are also a key factor in the production of health services. How much a country invests in new health facilities, diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, and information and communications technology (ICT) can have an important impact on the capacity of a health system to meet the healthcare needs of the population. Having sufficient equipment in intensive care units and other health settings helps to avoid potentially catastrophic delays in diagnosing and treating patients. Non-medical equipment is also important, notably the IT infrastructure needed to better monitor population health, both in acute situations and in the long term. Investing in capital equipment is therefore a prerequisite to strengthening overall health system resilience.",

The OECD-WTO methodology leverages all available official statistics and combines them with estimations and adjustments to provide users with a complete matrix covering virtually all economies in the world.\nII. BaTIS is balanced. To resolve the asymmetries between reported and mirror flows, exports and imports are reconciled by calculating a symmetry-index weighted average between the two, following a similar approach to that developed for international merchandise trade statistics.The dataset includes three core variables:\n- Reported value, which reflects the value officially reported by the country (where available);\n- Reported value including estimates, which reflects, in addition to the reported values, any adjustments made to ensure internal consistency as well as the estimations made by the OECD-WTO to fill in the gaps in the reported information; and:\n- Final balanced value, which reflects the reconciled bilateral trade flow, where exports equal mirror imports.Official information on bilateral trade flows was collected from OECD, Eurostat, national sources as well as UNSD. The WTO-UNCTAD trade in services dataset, based on a number of primary sources complemented with estimations, was the main source for data with partner world.The BaTIS dataset can be used as a stand-alone input for economic analysis and policy-making. In addition, balanced trade in services data form an essential input to the OECD Trade in Value Added (TiVA) initiative, for which a balanced view of international trade is crucial.\nBaTIS is intended to be regularly updated and constantly improved as new data become available.

It includes annual bilateral data for approximately 200 reporters and partners, broken down by 60 products in the Statistical Classification of Products by Activity (CPA 2.1) at the 2-digit level from 1995 to 2024. BIMTS is also available in the HS\u00a02017 classification at 2-digit, 4-digit and 6-digit levels of aggregation. The data at 4- and 6-digit levels can currently be accessed via the Related Files (bottom of the page). \n\u2022 BIMTS is complete and consistent. The OECD methodology leverages all available official statistics and combines them with estimations and adjustments to provide users with a complete matrix covering virtually all economies in the world. To provide users with consistent and long time series, the data is presented according to either HS2017 or CPA 2.1. \n\u2022 BIMTS is balanced. The OECD has developed a transparent approach to reconcile asymmetries in international merchandise trade statistics. A sequence of adjustments, documented in the BIMTS technical paper, significantly reduces asymmetries in the dataset before the final balancing procedure is performed. An important feature of BIMTS is a novel algorithm which identifies re-export flows and reallocates them to the producer countries before the balancing. To avoid double counting of flows between producers and trade hubs (already accounted for in the trade between producers and final users), BIMTS breaks down the final balanced values into a domestic component and a re-exports component. Users will therefore find two different measures of balanced trade flows (under the \u2018Adjustment\u2019 dimension): \n\u2022 Total balanced value: Represents the total reconciled bilateral trade flow, including re-exports.\n\u2022 Balanced value adjusted for re-exports: Represents the reconciled bilateral trade flow, adjusted for re-exports. This adjusted value is deemed to more accurately reflect economic reality and is therefore the preferred measure. In this database, the Reference area denotes the exporter, while the Counterpart area denotes the importer. Because the data are balanced, exports from the exporter to the importer equal imports by the importer from the exporter, and the flow is therefore recorded only once. Note that zero trade flows are represented in BIMTS as missing records (marked as \u201c..\u201d). This approach reduces the dataset size and improves processing times in the OECD Data Explorer.

OECD countries have two regional levels: large regions (territorial level 2 or TL2) and small regions (territorial level 3 or TL3). The OECD regions are presented in the OECD Territorial grid (pdf) and in the OECD Territorial correspondence table (xlsx).\u00a0\n\nCite this dataset\n\nOECD Regions and Cities databases\u00a0http://oe.cd/geostats\n\nFurther information\n\n\u2022 The interactive web-tool\u00a0OECD Regions and Cities Statistical Atlas\u00a0\n\u2022 The report OECD Regions and Cities at a Glance\n\nContact:\u00a0RegionStat@oecd.org",

To learn more about the database, visit the database's definitions and metadata.\n\nThis dataflow covers: Current well-being by educational attainment. \n\nThe distribution of current well-being is taken into account by looking at three types of inequality: gaps between population groups by age, educational attainment and sex (horizontal inequalities); gaps between those at the top and those at the bottom of the achievement scale in each dimension (vertical inequalities); and deprivations (i.e. the share of the population falling below a given threshold of achievement). \n\nIndicators are banded when sample size is below 1000 observations. \n\nCheck out the latest publication using this database How's Life? 2024 - Well-being and resilience in times of crisis and the How's Life? country notes.\n\nHave questions?

This database has been produced in the context of the OECD/EU joint project Strengthening analytical frameworks and data on subnational government finance and public employment, with the goal of collecting, standardising, and disseminating high-quality comparable data for local government finance and employment. \n\nThis data provides information to assess the capacities and decision-making power of municipalities and regions, whose role is essential in developing place-based policy. It also allows for within and cross-country comparisons, which sheds light on the disparities between subnational governments in terms of fulfilling their mandates and their ability to raise own-source revenue.

        "description": "Following the adoption of the OECD Council Recommendation on Public Integrity in 2017, the Public Governance Committee (PGC), via its Working Party of Senior Public Integrity Officials (SPIO) subsidiary body, developed the OECD Public Integrity Indicators (PII) to measure the implementation of the OECD Council Recommendation on Public Integrity. The PII are complementary to the OECD Public Integrity Handbook and the OECD Public Integrity Maturity Models.\n\nThe OECD Public Integrity Indicators (PII) measure the quality and effectiveness of public integrity systems across six areas:\n\u2022 Quality of Strategic Framework (data available)\n\u2022 Accountability of Public Policymaking \u2013 covering conflict-of-interest, political finance, lobbying, public information, open government, and public consultation (data available)\n\u2022 Effectiveness of Internal Control and Risk Management (data available)\n\u2022 Integrity and Effectiveness of the Justice System (to be launched in 2024)\n\u2022 Strength of External Oversight and Control (to be launched in 2024)\n\u2022 Meritocracy of the Public Sector (to be launched in 2025)The OECD Public Integrity Indicators provide cross-country comparative data to help policy makers and practitioners strengthen the resilience of public integrity systems towards corruption risks and prevent the mismanagement and waste of public funds. The PIIs measure the strength of standard regulatory safeguards (de jure) and implementation of these safeguards in practice (de facto). The OECD Secretariat collaborates closely with national administrations to obtain primary data collected directly from a wide range of actors across the executive, legislative and judiciary branches.\n\nData is collected for all 38 OECD member states (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, T\u00fcrkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States), two adherents to the OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity (Argentina and Peru), and one OECD key partner (Brazil).\n\nData is presented for each area as a set of indicators (listed under \u201cMeasure\u201d), which can be further broken down into criteria. Indicator values are calculated by counting the number of criteria fulfilled (based on OECD and other international standards) and expressing as a percentage of the total. Criteria values are binary, with a status of fulfilled represented as a 1 and a status of not fulfilled represented as a 0. Some outcome-level indicators consist of numerical rates calculated based on primary data values, either from administrative data sources (public registries) or surveys.\n\n\u201cData not available\u201d indicates that no data exists. \u201cData not provided\u201d represents data that was not provided during the data collection process and \u201cData pending\u201d represents data that is still being collected and/or assessed. \u201cNot tracking\u201d is used to indicate when administrations do not collate existing data into a central statistical measure.",

To promote international comparability, the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank have agreed on a set of standard debt measures, which are defined in the Public Sector Debt Statistics Guide for Compilers and Users and the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Government gross debt is shown in four categories: D1 to D4. D1 is the narrowest measure, comprising only two financial instruments: debt securities and loans. D4 (\u2018total gross debt\u2019) is the broadest measure and includes debt securities, loans, Special Drawing Rights, currency and deposits, other accounts payable and insurance, pensions and standardised guarantees. \n\nThe D1 to D3 measures are comparable between OECD countries. D4 is the preferred measure of debt in the international accounting standards (System of National Accounts or SNA) but cross-country comparability is more difficult for D4 because countries have different approaches to recording unfunded pension liabilities for government employees.\n\nFor more information, please see the document:\n\n Measuring Government Debt: D1-D4",

Jurisdictions apply a variety of criteria to determine control. Some approaches make reference to voting rights held by resident taxpayers or to shareholder value held by resident taxpayers, while others stipulate that a foreign company is a CFC if it carries out its operations in a low-tax jurisdiction and others base CFC designation on a taxation test (i.e., if the foreign company does not pay tax in its jurisdiction of residence). Jurisdictions also vary in their definitions of CFC income, with some applying CFC rules to any type of income while others apply them to only passive income (i.e., income from interest, rental property, dividends, royalties or capital gains).

        "description": "The OECD/G20 BEPS project identified the deductibility of interest as an important area of attention. In particular, profit shifting can arise from arrangements using third party debt (e.g., where one entity or jurisdiction bears an excessive proportion of the group\u2019s total net third party interest expense) and intragroup debt (e.g., where a group uses intragroup interest expense to shift taxable income from high tax to low tax jurisdictions).\n\nIn response, the 2015 BEPS Action 4 report focused on the use of all types of debt giving rise to excessive interest expense or used to finance the production of exempt or deferred income. In particular, the Action 4 final report established rules that linked an entity\u2019s net interest deductions to its level of economic activity within the jurisdiction, measured using taxable earnings before interest income, tax, depreciation and amortisation. This included three main elements:\n\u2022 A fixed ratio rule based on a benchmark net interest/EBITDA ratio\n\u2022 A group ratio rule allowing an entity to deduct more interest expense based on the position of its worldwide group\n\u2022 Targeted rules to address specific risks not addressed by the general rule.Further work on two aspects of the approach outlined in the Action 4 report was completed in 2017. The first addressed key elements of the design and operation of the group ratio rule, focusing on the calculation of net third party interest expense, the calculation of group-EBITDA and approaches to address the impact of entities with negative EBITDA. The second identified features of the banking and insurance sectors which can constrain the ability of groups to engage in BEPS involving interest, together with limits on these constraints, and approaches to deal with risks posed by entities in these sectors.\n\nThe OECD gathers information on progress related to the implementation of Action 4, namely, whether a jurisdiction has an interest limitation rule in place and, if so, the main design features of the rule. Design features include:\n\u2022 the type of rule (e.g., thin capitalisation, earnings stripping)\n\u2022 the financial ratio referenced\n\u2022 whether the rule is applicable to net or gross interest\n\u2022 whether the rule is applicable to related party debt and/or third party debt\n\u2022 whether a de minimus threshold is present\n\u2022 whether any exclusions apply\n\u2022 whether any loss carry-back or carry-forward provisions applyContact: CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org\n**Related Document\n\nBEPS Action 4 Interest Limitation Rules",

These regimes also provide benefits to income from other geographically mobile activities or provide benefits to a wide range of activities and do not necessarily exclude income from IP. The table shows information both on regimes that narrowly target IP income and on regimes that offer reduced rates to IP income and other types of income.\n\nAs agreed as part of the BEPS Action 5 minimum standard, peer reviews are undertaken to identify features of IP regimes that can facilitate base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) and therefore have the potential to unfairly impact the tax base of other jurisdictions. The Action 5 Report placed a renewed focus on requiring substantial activity for any preferential regime, and the \u201cnexus approach\u201d is the substantial activity requirement developed for IP regimes. The nexus approach requires a link between the income benefiting from the IP regime and the extent to which the taxpayer has undertaken the underlying R&D that generated the IP asset. In addition to the nexus approach, features of regimes such as ring-fencing from the domestic economy and a lack of transparency are also considered in the peer reviews.\n\nContact: CorporateTaxStatistics@OECD.org\n**Related Document\n\nOECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS: Progress Report July 2018-May 2019",

Income-based tax incentives provide relief in form of a reduced tax rate or tax exemption on revenues connected with outputs of the innovation activity of the firm. They comprise two broad categories of incentives: (i) intellectual property (IP) regimes that provide relief to the income derived from certain eligible IP assets (e.g. patent boxes), which can be related to the innovation activity of the firm, and (ii) dual category\u2019 regimes which provide relief to the entirety of business income (i.e. not necessarily IP-based) but restricted to eligible businesses deemed to be engaged in R&D or other innovation-related activities. The new indicator included in the OECD R&D Tax Incentives database specifies the cost of income-based tax support for R&D and innovation to governments in terms of foregone tax revenue.

        "description": "The OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index (FDIRRI) - Regulatory Database provides information on all regulatory measures underlying the FDIRRI, including extracts of key legislation, explanatory comments, sources, and links. The Regulatory Database also shows the scores associated with each individual regulatory measure. Please note, however, that these do not represent sector or economy-level scores. Note also that the horizontal (cross-sector) measures recorded in the database may not necessarily apply to all sectors or sub-sectors and may sometimes overlap with other sector-specific database entries. The overlap of horizontal and sector-specific entries does not affect FDIRRI scores, i.e., it does not result in double counting. For cross-country comparisons, users should refer to the OECD FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index - Scores database. The OECD FDIRRI is a policy-based tool designed to measure statutory restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) across countries and over time. First established in 2003 and last revised in 2022, the FDIRRI serves as a benchmark for evaluating market access and other regulatory barriers to FDI, while also providing a means to monitor and promote FDI policy reforms. The FDIRRI assesses regulatory restrictions in 22 economic sectors, categorised into four policy areas: foreign equity limits, screening and approval, restrictions on key foreign personnel, and other restrictions. Only statutory measures that discriminate against foreign investors, or which are deemed particularly more burdensome to foreign investors, are accounted for as restrictions. Other important aspects of the investment climate (e.g., regulatory transparency, state monopolies, and any preferential treatment for selected investors, such as treaty-covered investors or those in special economic zones), as well as measures implemented for protecting the public order and essential security interests are not considered. Each policy measure is scored on a scale from 0 (fully open to FDI) to 1 (fully closed), with sectoral scores reflecting the sum across all policy categories, capped at 1. Standard sector weights are applied consistently across countries and over time to capture differences in the economic significance of sectors, ensuring that any variation in scores between countries is attributed to policy differences. Data are collected annually and reflect regulatory restrictions as of end December of the indicated year.Please refer to the FDIRRI webpage for further details on the methodology.",

Each policy measure is scored on a scale from 0 (fully open to FDI) to 1 (fully closed), with sectoral scores reflecting the sum across all policy categories, capped at 1. Standard sector weights are applied consistently across countries and over time to capture differences in the economic significance of sectors, ensuring that any variation in scores between countries is attributed to policy differences. Data are collected annually and reflect regulatory restrictions as of end December of the indicated year.Please refer to the FDIRRI webpage for further details on the methodology.",

The difference between assets and liabilities is the net international investment position and represents either a net claim on, or a net liability to, the rest of the world. Data are shown by categories of investment, such as direct investment, portfolio investment, and reserve assets, each with expanded detail available. Understanding the types of investment held by foreign owners can shed light on the vulnerability of an economy to changes in external market conditions.\n\nThis dataset presents economies compiling international investment position statistics in accordance with the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual published by the IMF (BPM6), providing strong cross-country comparability.\nAs such the main purpose of this dataset is to provide relevant, reliable, consistent, comparable and timely aggregate quarterly international investment position statistics for analytical purposes. Nevertheless there are some deviations from standard definitions that are indicated in notes (see \u00ab i \u00bb attached to series).\n\nIn the international investment position, for net value, a positive sign indicates a net stock from the domestic economy to the rest of the world (a lending to, or claim on, the rest of the world) and a negative sign, a net stock from the rest of the world to the domestic economy (i.e. a net borrowing from the rest of the world). At the level of the sub items (investment abroad, investment in the reporting economy etc.), a positive sign indicates a stock of assets (claims) of the sub item under consideration and a negative sign a stock of liabilities. These conventions are imposed by the BPM6.\n\nThe dataflow covers : all OECD member countries, G20 economies and a selection of non-member economies.\n\nThe currency unit used for all series is:\nMillions of US dollars or Millions of National Currency.\n\nOECD statistics contact: stat.contact@oecd.org\n\nhttp://www.oecd.org/sdd",

As there are no harmonised definitions of venture capital stages across venture capital associations and other data providers, original data have been re-aggregated to fit the OECD classification of venture capital by stages. Korea, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and South Africa do not provide breakdowns of venture capital by stage that would allow meaningful international comparisons.\n\nThe attached table shows the correspondences between original data and OECD harmonised data for venture capital investments by stage.\n\nhttps://stats.oecd.org/wbos/fileview2.aspx?IDFile=2aa27890-769e-4f10-843a-a654c5e7b24e\n\nVenture capital is a form of equity financing particularly relevant for young companies with innovation and growth potential but untested business models and no track record; it replaces or complements traditional bank finance. The development of the venture capital industry is considered an important framework condition to stimulate innovative entrepreneurship. Aggregate data on venture capital provide useful information on trends in the venture capital industry.\n\nThese data are typically compiled by national or regional Private Equity and Venture Capital Associations, often with the support of commercial data providers. The quality and availability of aggregate data on venture capital have improved considerably in recent years; international comparisons, however, remain complicated because of two main problems.\n\nThe first difficulty comes from the lack of a standard international definition of venture capital. While there is a general understanding, the definition of the types of investments included in venture capital varies across countries and regions. In some cases, differences are purely linguistic; in others, they are more substantive. The second problem relates to the diverse methodologies employed by data compilers. The completeness and representativeness of venture capital statistics with respect to the venture capital industry of a country will differ depending on how data were collected.\n\nThe units used are : Millions of US Dollars and share of GDP.\n\nOECD statistics contact: stat.contact@oecd.org",

This measure was chosen as it is the most widely available across countries. However, amounts obtained with this method are not directly comparable with grants and tax expenditures, so the two types of instruments are recorded and analysed separately.\n\nThe QuIS webpage summarises the key findings of the first cross-country report and provides country notes and factsheets.

The database is compiled based on annual data collection by the OECD Secretariat for some countries and via collaboration with Eurostat, which collects statistics for all EU member states plus Norway and Switzerland. The gross nutrient balances for nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P), expressed in tonnes, are calculated as the difference between the total quantity of nutrients entering an agricultural system (mainly as fertilisers and livestock manure) and the quantity of nutrients leaving the system (mainly via uptake by crops and grassland). The nutrient balance indicator can be used as a proxy to reveal the status of environmental pressures. A positive nutrient balance represents a nutrient surplus (inputs exceed outputs), which can lead to nutrient pollution of air and water resources. A negative nutrient balance represents a deficit (outputs exceed inputs), which can lead to degradation in soil fertility. The nutrient balance indicator is also reported on a per unit land area basis, in kilogrammes of nutrients per hectare of agricultural land.
